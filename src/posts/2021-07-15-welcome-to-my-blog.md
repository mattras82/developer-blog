Hello and welcome to my humble blog. ðŸ˜Š

I'm glad you're here. I'm using this little corner of the internet to document the problems, solutions, thoughts, projects, tools, and anything else I happen upon that are related to my web development adventures.

## About Me
I have been a web developer by trade for nearly six years. I have worked on all sorts of websites, from WordPress to Shopify to NopCommerce to custom PHP, and now I'm in charge of redesigning a custom eCommerce site built on a perl backend. I have worked for non-profits, private corporations, and a full-service web agency. I've been doing freelance web development on the side for 4 years.

I prefer doing full-stack development. I'm mostly versed in PHP and .NET on the backend, but I've dabbled in NodeJS, Python, Go, and some other back end languages. On the javascript side, I've worked on everything from jQuery to Knockout to Angular to React to Vue and several tools in between. My preferred front-end stack is Sass for styling and vanilla JavaScript for functionality. I'm in the process of learning Typescript right now, and I like what I've seen so far. I'm hoping to start integrating Typescript into my projects in the near future.

## Follow Along
I'll be writing on this blog as much as I can. Most of the posts will likely be a description of an issue - or set of issues - that I had to find my own solution for. I use StackOverflow, DuckDuckGo, and several online development blogs every day while I work. I want to start giving back to the community that has allowed me to get to where I am now.

If you've made it this far, consider following my RSS feed to stay up to date on what I'm working on.

### Happy Coding! :)
